# Week 1 Tasks: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

**Authors:** HuyNQ, Cursor AI  
**Document Summary:** This document provides a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough for completing Week 1 objectives of the MindX Engineer Onboarding program. The guide covers building and deploying a full-stack application on Azure Cloud infrastructure, progressing from a simple containerized API to a complete authenticated web application. Each step builds incrementally, introducing core DevOps concepts including containerization, Azure services, Kubernetes orchestration, and authentication integration. The final deliverable is a production-ready full-stack application running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with proper authentication flows.

**Customization Note:** This guide can be customized and tailored to your preferences, tech stack choices, or project requirements, as long as the end goals from the Week 1 overview are met. Feel free to adapt the steps, technologies, or deployment approaches to match your learning objectives or organizational needs.

**Example Prompt for Customization:**
_"Here is the original plan for first week [The guide]. I want to develop both API and web app in the same repo rather than separate repos, tailor this guide to that direction, make sure the end goals are still met."_

Other customization examples:

- Using different authentication providers or databases
- Modifying deployment strategies or container orchestration approaches

This document provides a detailed walkthrough of the tasks needed to complete Week 1 objectives. Each step builds upon the previous one to create a full-stack application deployed on Azure Cloud.

## ðŸ”§ Sys Admin / DevOps Collaboration Guide

Throughout this guide, you'll see **ðŸ”§ Sys Admin / DevOps Check** or **ðŸ”§ DevOps Collaboration** notes. These indicate tasks that may require elevated permissions or collaboration with your infrastructure team.

**Permission Levels:**

- **Developer:** Can write code, build containers, create basic Kubernetes resources
- **DevOps:** Can manage cloud resources, install cluster tools, configure CI/CD
- **Sys Admin:** Can manage domains, DNS, security policies, and provision infrastructure

**Quick Self-Assessment:**

- Run `az account show` - Do you see subscription details?
- Run `kubectl cluster-info` - Can you see cluster information?
- Check if you can access your organization's DNS management console

If any checks fail, coordinate with your infrastructure team early in the process.

## Step 1: Simple Repository with Azure Container Registry and API Deployment

### Overview

Create a minimal API application, containerize it, push to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploy to Azure Web App. Note that despite the name "Azure Web App," this service can host both APIs and web applications - we'll be deploying an API.

**ðŸ“‹ Alternative Approach:** For a more aggressive learning path, Azure Web App deployment can be skipped entirely. You can proceed directly to Step 2 (AKS deployment) after completing tasks 1.1-1.4. This approach saves time but misses the opportunity to compare different Azure hosting options.

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Docker installed locally
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Git repository access

**ðŸ”§ Sys Admin / DevOps Check:**

- **Azure Permissions Required:** Can you create Azure Container Registry, Azure Web App, and AKS clusters?
- **Simple Test:** Try running `az group create --name test-rg --location eastus` (delete after test)
- **If No Access:** Request Azure subscription contributor/owner permissions from Sys Admin

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Create Simple API

Build a basic Node.js/TypeScript Express API server with health check and hello world endpoints. The API should be production-ready with proper TypeScript configuration and build scripts.

#### 1.2 Containerize the API

Create a Docker container for the API with optimized image size and proper configuration. The container should run the API successfully in any environment.

#### 1.3 Set Up Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Establish an Azure Container Registry to store container images. Configure authentication and ensure local Docker can connect to push images.

**ðŸ”§ DevOps Collaboration:** Creating ACR requires Azure permissions

- **Check:** Can you run `az acr create --name myregistry --resource-group mygroup --sku Basic`?
- **If No:** Ask DevOps team to create ACR and provide access credentials

#### 1.4 Build and Push Container Image to ACR

Build the Docker image locally, tag it properly, and push to Azure Container Registry. Test the push process and verify the image is stored and accessible for deployment.

#### 1.5 Deploy API to Azure Web App from ACR

Create an Azure Web App service configured to pull and run the containerized API from Azure Container Registry. Configure the service with proper settings and health checks, ensuring it uses the pushed container image.

**ðŸ”§ DevOps Collaboration:** Azure Web App creation requires permissions

- **Check:** Can you run `az webapp create --name myapp --resource-group mygroup --plan myplan`?
- **If No:** Ask DevOps team to create Web App or provide App Service Contributor role

#### 1.6 Verify API Deployment

Ensure the deployed API is accessible via public HTTPS URL and all endpoints respond correctly. Confirm logging and monitoring are working.

#### 1.7 Repository Setup

Initialize Git repository with all code, configurations, and documentation. Push to remote repository with proper version tagging and comprehensive README.

### Deliverables for Step 1

- Working containerized API deployed to Azure Web App
- Public HTTPS API endpoint accessible via Azure Web App URL
- Container image stored in Azure Container Registry
- Complete source code in Git repository
- Documentation for local development and deployment process

**Note:** If using the alternative approach (skipping Azure Web App), deliverables are limited to ACR setup, containerized API, and repository with documentation.

### Success Criteria

- API responds to HTTP requests on the Azure Web App URL
- Container image successfully stored and retrievable from ACR
- All source code and configurations are version controlled
- Documentation allows another developer to reproduce the deployment
- Health check endpoint returns successful response

**Alternative Success Criteria:** If skipping Azure Web App, ensure container image works locally and is successfully pushed to ACR, ready for AKS deployment in Step 2.

## Step 2: Deploy Application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

### Overview

Deploy the containerized API from Step 1 to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This step introduces container orchestration and prepares the infrastructure for scaling and managing multiple services.

### Prerequisites

- Completed Step 1 with working Azure Web App deployment (or alternative approach with ACR setup only)
- Azure Container Registry with pushed container image
- kubectl installed locally
- Azure CLI with AKS extension

**ðŸ“‹ Note:** If you skipped Azure Web App deployment in Step 1, you can proceed directly with the container image from ACR.

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Create AKS Cluster

Provision an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with appropriate node configuration. The cluster should be properly configured for development workloads with basic networking and security settings.

**ðŸ”§ Sys Admin Collaboration:** AKS requires significant Azure permissions

- **Check:** Can you run `az aks create --name myaks --resource-group mygroup --node-count 1`?
- **If No:** AKS creation typically requires Sys Admin - request cluster creation or Kubernetes Service Contributor role

#### 2.2 Configure Cluster Access

Set up local kubectl access to the AKS cluster and verify connectivity. Ensure the cluster can pull images from the existing Azure Container Registry.

**ðŸ”§ DevOps Collaboration:** Requires AKS access permissions

- **Check:** Can you run `az aks get-credentials --name myaks --resource-group mygroup`?
- **If No:** Ask DevOps team for AKS access or kubeconfig file

#### 2.3 Create Kubernetes Manifests

Write Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files for the API. Include proper resource limits, health checks, and service exposure configuration.

#### 2.4 Deploy API to AKS from ACR

Apply the Kubernetes manifests to deploy the API to AKS. Configure the deployment to pull and use the existing container image from Azure Container Registry (pushed in Step 1).

#### 2.5 Expose API Service

Create a Kubernetes ClusterIP service for the API. This will prepare the API for internal cluster communication and later ingress routing.

#### 2.6 Verify Internal AKS Deployment

Test the API deployment within the cluster using port-forwarding or internal cluster access. Confirm the API pods are running and health checks are working.

#### 2.7 Update Repository

Commit all Kubernetes manifests and deployment scripts to the Git repository. Update documentation to include AKS deployment instructions alongside the Azure Web App deployment.

### Deliverables for Step 2

- Working AKS cluster with deployed API
- Kubernetes manifests for deployment and ClusterIP service
- API accessible internally within the AKS cluster
- Updated repository with AKS deployment documentation
- Both Azure Web App and AKS API deployments running simultaneously

### Success Criteria

- API responds to HTTP requests via internal cluster access (port-forwarding)
- Kubernetes pods are running and healthy in the cluster
- AKS cluster can successfully pull images from Azure Container Registry
- Both API deployment methods (Azure Web App and AKS) are documented and functional
- Health check endpoints work correctly in both environments
